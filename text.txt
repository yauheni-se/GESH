Coding convention:
- UpperCamelCase;
- UI and server modules' name start with menuItem name; UI modules end with `UI`, server modules end with `Server`;
- Modules have prefix `Md` in the very beginning; Functions have prefix `Fn`.
- namespaces for UI and server modules are the same as menuItem name;
- id's within modules end with such abbreviations:
  - Btn for buttons,
  - Slct for selectors, text areas, radio buttons,
  - Tbl for tables,
  - Gr for graphs,
  - Var for variables;
